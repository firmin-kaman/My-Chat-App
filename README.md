Epitech-Project on MERN

How do I get started?

Open three terminals:
1 for the client
1 for the MongoDB server
1 for the MySQL server

1- Install dependencies with "npm install".
2- Configure your MySQL and MongoDB databases to use the services (tables, models, management rules, etc.).
3- Run "npm start".

This readme is incomplete and will be finished very soon...
